# OpenMensa Parsers
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/mswart/openmensa-parsers.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mswart/openmensa-parsers)

[OpenMensa] is a free canteen database. It depends on external parsers that provide the meal information for the specific canteens.

This repository contains a large collection of parsers for different canteens all over Germany - mostly university canteens provided by student unions.

Before you continue you may want to read the [feed documentation] describing the exchange format between parsers and OpenMensa.


## Contribute
**Corrections Welcome**: As I do not use most of the parsers myself it is likely that I miss some parsing issues. Feel free to report an issue or even better provide a pull request.

**Hosting Provided**: Your canteen is missing? You could write a parser for your canteen (in Python)? But you do not know where to host the parser? I can host your parser at omfeeds.devtation.de. Please provide a PR with the new parser.


## Overall Structure
The parsers itself are independent. But there is a small framework handling common tasks like URL parsing and output generation.

Each provider has it's own Python module. A provider represents a collection of canteens which are organisationally dependent and therefore can be parsed by the same process. The module itself has to implement a `parse_url(canteenidentifier, today=False)` method. This method is called to parse and return the feed for a specific canteen. What the `canteenidentifier` is exactly is up to the provider - mostly they are URL parts or URL suffixes.

The [config.py] contains a list of all known providers and it's canteens (plus the `canteenidentifier` that is passed to the `parse_url` method). The structure is hopefully self explaining. If not, please open an issue.


# Writing Parsers
## Learn
At the moment all providers in this repo are using [PyOpenMensa] ([documentation](https://pyopenmensa.readthedocs.io/), [repo](https://github.com/mswart/pyopenmensa)) to generate the XML feed and for the parsing itself.

As often the menu is only available as HTML, [Beautiful Soup 4] is used as a robust but easy to use HTML parser.

1. Clone the source code:

        git clone --recurse-submodules git://github.com/mswart/openmensa-parsers

2. Install the dependencies:
   * [Python 3]
   * [Beautiful Soup 4] - needed for most parsers/providers.
   * [python-lxml] Some parsers use the `lxml` backend of Beautiful Soup, so you might need the Python `lxml` module/extension.

3. See a working example of a feed. E. g. from the `ovgu-unten` canteen in `magdeburg`:

        python3 parse.py magdeburg ovgu-unten full.xml

   Command usage:

        python3 parse.py <provider name> <canteen name> <feed>.xml

   The `full` feed returns the entire menu and is called once a day. Alternatively, the `today` feed is called hourly, but is meant to only return today's menu. Use one of these as `<feed>` in the command.
    
4. Look at the parser's source code. All the `magdeburg` parsers are defined in `parsers/magedburg.py`. This is because the canteens only differ in their URLs and can share the same parser.

   You can compare multiple parsers to see what libraries they use and how they register parsers.


## Write
Let's imagine you want to create a parser for the `eatmaginary` canteen located in `essendorf`.

1. Find a online resource where the `eatmaginary` menu is accessible online.
   - JSON or CSV downloads are preferred
   - HTML sites are fine
   - PDF is tricky.
2. Create the new parser in e. g. `parsers/essendorf.py`. It has to have a function that creates a valid XML feed.
3. Export a `parser` by making it a global variable in `parsers/essendorf.py`. Use the `Parser` class from `utils.py` and pass it the function that creates the XML feed. You can also register multiple canteens with the same parser. Look at some parsers' source code to get a feel for how this works.
4. Register your parser in `config.py`. Normally it is enough to add your city, e. g. `essendorf`, to the `cities` list.
5. If you want to refactor your parser, you can create a [regression test](#regression-tests) that will tell you, if you've changed how the parser works.
6. Submit a PR to GitHub containing these changes. ([Tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#pr) for opening a pull request.)
7. Wait until the PR is reviewed and merged.
8. Register the new canteens on [openmensa] with the feed from `http://omfeeds.devtation.de/<provider identifier>/<canteen identifier>.xml` and (optional) today feed from `http://omfeeds.devtation.de/<provider identifier>/<canteen identifier>/today.xml`.
   In our example these URLs would be `http://omfeeds.devtation.de/essendorf/eatmaginary.xml`.

## <a name="regression-tests">Regression Tests</a>
A regression test allows you to detect whether you've broken your parser. If you change your parser and it then accidentally has a different output, that is called a regression.

It can be useful to refactor your code, i. e. to restructure it without changing what it does. In these cases, you will benefit from knowing when you've accidentally changed what your parser outputsâ€”it happens all the time. A regression test will tell you exactly that.

### How It Works
The regression tests work with snapshots. They will remember what website you called and store them, along with the XML feed that your parser generated.

This means that even in the next week, when the website may display a new menu, you can check your parser with the same menu as before and see if your changes have introduced a regression.

Being able to rerun the parser on a known menu is very valuable, since you only need to check the output for bugs one time. With our regression test, you will know that you have already checked the output and if your parser does something differently, the test will tell you.

### Setup
   1. Create your first snapshot using the command  `.parser_tests/update_snapshot essendorf eatmaginary`.
   2. Make sure that the result in `parser_tests/essendorf/eatmaginary/snapshot-result.xml` is correct.
   3. Register your parser to be tested by adding it to the list in `parser_tests/regression_test.py`. Add it as a tuple `(<parser>, <canteen>)`, so in our example `('essendorf', 'eatmaginary')`.
   4. If not already done, install `pytest` using `pip install pytest`.
   5. Run all tests using the command `pytest`.

### Updating Snapshots
When you've fixed a bug in your parser, the output changes. The regression test will fail, because it doesn't know that this change is wanted.

You can fix this by updating the snapshot. Unfortunately, you will have to manually recheck the output to make sure you didn't change something by accident.

1. Make sure that only the changes you wanted happened by looking at the failed test's diff or checking it manually.
2. Run the updater using `./parser_tests/update_snapshots.py <parser> <canteen>`, so in our example `./parser_tests/update_snapshots.py essendorf eatmaginary`.

Now your snapshot will use the current menu. Don't forget to double check that the output doesn't contain any errors.
